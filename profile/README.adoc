= About Betrayd
It's a recreation of Gmod's Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) - in Minecraft!

We are a small group of people who enjoy TTT and Minecraft, so we decided to bring them together. +
Using custom plugins, a custom resource pack, and amazing maps we strive to bring truly unique gameplay to Minecraft with custom-coded and designed guns, hats, and more!
